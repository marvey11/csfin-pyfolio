## Repository Overview

`csfin-pyfolio` is a Python 3.12 uv workspace for a finance portfolio application.
The workspace members are declared in the root `pyproject.toml`:

- `libs/core`: shared domain models, configuration, repositories, and services.
- `apps/app-workers`: Typer command-line workers for configuration and stocks.
- `apps/pyfolio`: the main pyfolio application package.

The repository uses a `src` layout. Import packages through their installed package
names, not by reaching into source directories with relative filesystem assumptions.

## Source Boundaries

- Put reusable domain behavior in `libs/core/src/core`.
- Keep CLI parsing, command handlers, console rendering, and process lifecycle code
  in `apps/app-workers/src/app_workers`.
- Keep tests next to the package they validate, under the corresponding `tests`
  directory.
- Preserve public service and repository APIs unless the task explicitly requires a
  contract change.
- Configuration loading belongs behind `ConfigurationService` where that service
  provides the needed operation. Do not duplicate configuration file parsing in
  application workers.

## Development Conventions

- Target Python 3.12 or newer.
- Use 4 spaces and a maximum line length of 88 characters.
- Use double-quoted strings, consistent with Ruff format configuration.
- Add explicit annotations for functions, parameters, and return values.
- Prefer `typing.Annotated` for Typer command arguments and options when defining
  CLI metadata.
- Use Rich `Console` instances for CLI output. Use a stderr console for warnings
  and errors and a stdout console for normal output.
- Preserve command exit codes and user-visible output unless changing the CLI
  contract is part of the task.
- Raise exceptions with `from err` when converting an underlying error at a
  boundary, such as a CLI handler.
- Avoid broad refactors and unrelated formatting changes.
- Do not add comments that merely restate the code. Add a comment only when the
  reason for a non-obvious decision cannot be expressed clearly in the code.

## Tests

Tests use pytest and are discovered from `apps` and `libs` according to the root
`pyproject.toml`. The default test command enables branch coverage and fails when
total coverage is below 80%.

Use fixtures and monkeypatching to isolate services, repositories, filesystem paths,
and other external state. For CLI tests, use `typer.testing.CliRunner` and assert
exit codes plus meaningful output. Follow the existing worker test pattern when
mocking a service factory.

## Validation and Verification Commands

Run commands from the repository root with uv available.

### Install and synchronize

```sh
uv sync --locked --all-packages --all-extras --dev
```

Use this before validation or when dependencies, workspace metadata, or `uv.lock`
change. The locked form ensures the installed dependency graph matches the lockfile.

### CI checks

The authoritative CI workflow is [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
It runs these commands after installing dependencies:

```sh
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run --all-packages mypy .
uv run --all-packages pytest
```

Run the same sequence locally before submitting a change. Ruff lint checks rules
configured in `pyproject.toml`, Ruff format check detects unformatted files, mypy
runs strict type checking, and pytest runs the complete workspace suite with the
configured coverage threshold.

### Formatting and linting

```sh
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

Use `--fix` and `ruff format .` only when you intend to modify files. Review the
resulting diff afterward. The CI-safe commands are the non-mutating checks.

### Type checking

```sh
uv run mypy .
uv run --all-packages mypy .
```

The workspace-wide form used by CI is `uv run --all-packages mypy .`. Use it when
validating imports and types across all workspace packages.

### Tests and coverage

```sh
uv run --all-packages pytest
uv run pytest
uv run pytest -o addopts='' <path/to/test_file.py>
uv run pytest -o addopts='' <path/to/test_file.py> -k <test_expression>
```

The first command is the CI-equivalent full suite. The second is useful for normal
local execution. The last two are focused checks that disable the repository-wide
coverage threshold so a small test slice can be evaluated quickly. The default
pytest configuration also writes terminal, XML, and HTML coverage reports.

For the worker CLI tests, use:

```sh
uv run pytest -o addopts='' \
  apps/app-workers/tests/test_config_worker.py \
  apps/app-workers/tests/test_stock_worker.py
```

### Pre-commit verification

```sh
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push
```

The configured hooks verify the uv lockfile, large files, JSON, TOML, YAML, EOFs,
trailing whitespace, Ruff linting, and Ruff formatting. The pre-push stage also runs:

```sh
uv run --all-packages pytest
```

Run pre-commit after changing Python, configuration, workflow, or lock files.

### Syntax and diagnostics

```sh
python -m compileall apps libs
uv run pytest --collect-only
```

Use `compileall` for a quick Python syntax check and `pytest --collect-only` to
verify test discovery without executing tests.

## Change Workflow

1. Read the owning implementation and its neighboring tests before editing.
2. Make the smallest change that addresses the requested behavior.
3. Run a focused test or check immediately after the first edit.
4. Run Ruff, mypy, and relevant tests for the touched packages.
5. Run the complete CI-equivalent sequence for cross-package or shared changes.
6. Review `git diff` and ensure generated coverage artifacts or unrelated files are
   not included unintentionally.

## CI and Pull Requests

Changes targeting `main` are validated by the `code-quality` job in
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) on pushes and pull requests.
The workflow uses Python 3.12, installs with `uv sync --locked`, and requires all
Ruff, mypy, and pytest checks to pass.

Do not weaken lint, type, test, or coverage settings to make a change pass. Fix the
underlying code or add focused tests for the behavior being changed.
